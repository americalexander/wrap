/** wrap: an Algorithm B implementation
 * @author William E. Alexander
 * @author Rahul Patel
 * @author Adam Nodjomian
 * @author Prashanth Venkatraman
 * 
 * This project will implement Algorithm B, as presented 
 * by Dial (2006) in order to create a solver for the
 * Traffic Assignment Problem as defined by Beckmann et 
 * al. (1956). The aim for this project is to implement a
 * time- and space-efficient framework of Algorithm B
 * which can be studied, extended, and executed properly.
 * We also aim to provide quality documentation and testing
 * of our code, in order that this project will serve as a
 * good exercise in practicing proper software development
 * techniques. 
 * 
 * This project will be completed as part of the requirements
 * for the CE 392C Transportation Network Analysis course 
 * at the University of Texas at Austin during the Fall 2017
 * semester, with the potential for further development to
 * follow.
